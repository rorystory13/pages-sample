## Welcome everyone to my training wheels website

I can write all sorts of text here. Who knows if I'll ever add anything of substance. No apologies if I mess this up. Training wheels remember? 

#### Here are some example pages:

- [Markdown](02-markdown-examples)
- [Images](03-images-examples)
- [Embeds](04-embeds-examples)

**Add an image from your directory:**

You can also add images from a file directory. If you're using GitHub Pages, that means you would want a folder where your content or images live in your GitHub repository. But note that internal links from a "post" can be a little tricky. See the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#links).
